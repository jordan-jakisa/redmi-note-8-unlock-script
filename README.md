# Redmi Note 8 FRP Lock Prevention Tool

A utility script that helps prevent Factory Reset Protection (FRP) lock activation on Redmi Note 8 devices when users have lost access to their Mi Account credentials. This tool removes the system components responsible for FRP lock enforcement.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice

This tool should only be used if:
- You are the legitimate owner of the device
- You have lost access to your Mi Account credentials
- You need to prevent FRP lock activation before performing a factory reset

## üì± Device Compatibility

- Model: Redmi Note 8
- MIUI Versions: All versions
- Android Versions: All supported versions

## üîß What This Tool Does

The script removes four critical system components that handle device locking and cloud authentication:
1. Mi Account Manager (prevents account verification)
2. Find Device Service (disables device tracking)
3. Cloud Service (removes cloud authentication)
4. Cloud Sync (prevents sync-based verification)

This allows you to perform a factory reset without triggering the FRP lock.
